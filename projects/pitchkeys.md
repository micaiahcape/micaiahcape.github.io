This is a fullstack, responsive website that allows visitors to my YouTube channel to download the music I create. Users can sort and filter songs by keyword, bpm, genre, duration, rating, artist, etc..., and can also submit ratings for the songs. This is the first fullstack web application I created.

You can view the site here: [pitchkeys.github.io](https://pitchkeys.github.io/)

More specifically, users can download the mp3, MIDI, the MuseScore file (to edit MIDI), or the sheet music (if applicable) of each song.

While creating this site, I learned the basics of React.js and was able to implement what I learned about basic backend development from [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). All songs' info are stored in a MongoDB database, and I was successfully able to design a simple API to retrieve the proper requested songs from the database.
