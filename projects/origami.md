## About

This is a static, responsive website that hosts instructions to all my original origami models. I've created many different types of 2D or 3D models, such as futuristic vehicles, sea creatures, etc...

You can view the site here: [origamitician.github.io](https://origamitician.github.io/)

## Some models

I used Inkscape, a drawing software, to create the instruction diagrams. Here are some of the models I'm the most proud of:
