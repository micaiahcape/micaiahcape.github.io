Stravalytics is a web application that I built where users can analyze their running data in detail. When on the site, simply connect the "Connect to Strava" button to link your Strava accounts, and see your statistics via beautiful visualizations!

You can view the site here: [stravalytics.cyclic.cloud](https://stravalytics.cyclic.cloud/)

Stravalytics currently has the following visualizations:
 - Histograms that sort your activities by pace, elevation gain, distance, and uptime.
 - An interactive scatterplot that allows you to analyze relationship between many different variables, such as cadence, stride length, distance, heart rate, elevation gain, etc...
 - Totals, averages, and moving averages of most run statistics, visualized by line graphs!
 - Analyzing a single week, month, or year's worth of activities in detail (coming soon)
