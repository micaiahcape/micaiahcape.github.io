### Problem
There is limited information online on what kind of condition the dorms are in (e.g. how clean the bathrooms are, etc…). There are also no roommate finder apps specific for UH Manoa, which may cause students to take a gamble when choosing a random roommate.

### Solution
Provide a way for students to gain more information about the dorms, give insight into living experiences, and allow students to connect with other students in order to find people they would like to dorm with.

### Mockup ideas
+ Use google maps API to create interactable “pins” on the dorm buildings (home page). Clicking on the pins will take you to the dorms summary page

+ For login, ask the individual questions that may help search for potential roommates (e.g. where they’re considering to live next year, where they’re living right now, ideal # of roommates, drug & alcohol policy, etc…)

+ For the dorms summary page, there can be an option to numerically rate a particular dorm room (e.g. a double room in Gateway house) and also an option to type out any relevant comments. There can also be an interactive area where students can “draw” out the layout of their room, or upload an image for those that are curious of the layout. A small thing, but people can also rate the amenities of the dorm (e.g. quality of water fountains, cleanliness of bathrooms, overall social scene, typical noise levels, heat (due to lack of AC)).

+ For the searching page, there can be options to filter via name, dorm building preference, # of roommates, academic standing, etc…) which will show a list of profiles that will match that. Clicking on a profile requests that person for you to be a roommate, and that other person can either accept or deny that request.

+ On the profile page, one can edit their bio as well as other attributes. 

### Use Case Ideas
The project will be organized where it will provide easier and direct access to dorm living for students, in comparison to the current dorm registration process for on-campus living. It will be a combination between a review forum and information base as well as a social platform for students who are dorming. 

For example, say a student is new to UH and is deciding on where they want to dorm, but are still unsure of which dorm they wish to reside in, they can visit this site, create a profile, and then research the different dorm buildings that they are interested in while hearing first-hand feedback from students who are currently living or have lived in those dorms. Another example may be if a student currently living in the dorms wants to transfer to a different building, but they do not know what the other dorms are like.

### Beyond the basics
If the application gets advanced enough, we can implement a dm system into the app, or allow users to create their own profile to advertise their socials for potential connections.
