### Why I took this class

I took this class because I enjoyed the project-driven curriculum of ICS 314. Rather than sitting thru a bunch of tedious lectures on software engineering theory, I appreciated the hands-on approach to building small, but functional websites (both frontend and backend). The 314 class left my mind searching for a similar experience, as I believe that hands-on learning will allow me to gain the most relevant experience if I'm going to be a software engineer. 

Looking at the past course's website for 414, I realized that we'd be developing something for a client, which was exactly what I was looking for. Without further ado, I put this class in my schedule!

### Team's experience

In this semester, we wered asked to develop an accounting software for Spire Hawaii (a local accounting company). They wanted to convert the spreadsheet that is used by their accountants to a online, web-based tool.

We were offered two different frameworks to work with (we could choose one of two):

 - Meteor.js: the framework that was used in 314. Uses React as the frontend and MongoDB as the backend.
 - Next.js: the "newer" framework. Also uses React as the frontend (enforced with TypeScript) and PostgreSQL as the backend.

We elected to use Next.js as our framework as we had some trouble setting up Meteor.js in 314, and we wanted to hit the ground running. The work was organized as follows:

 - Junle worked on the backend of the analyst page.
 - Mairi worked on the frontend of the analyst page.
 - I (Micaiah) worked on the auditor page.
 - Karissa worked on the executive page.
 - Sage worked on the admin page.
 - Michaella and Chester filled in wherever they needed (as they didn't have a specific page assigned to them.)

There were little to no hiccups in terms of meeting the milestones early on during the semester. Our team got along very well and progress was slowly being made. After creating the mockups, we went straight into coding and pushed to GitHub. Later on in the semester, when all our team members got busy, the pushes became more intermittent, but we still managed to meet deadlines. The biggest breakthrough for our team came before the final milestone at the end of the semester, where we adopted a unified, streamlined look on our website so can users can navigate between the different accounting tools easily. This was a huge jump from inconsistent theming we had at the beginning of the semester

### My experience

I created 3 goals for this class this semester:

1.	Learn a new framework for developing web applications.

Although next.js had a minor learning curve, especially with the typescript enforcement, it wasn't too bad. We also used [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components, which helped us keep the design consistent. I was able to experience transferring the formulas from the old accounting spreadsheet, and also use AI like ChatGPT to understand some of the logic behind some of the formulas (as some of them were not intuitive). I’ve also used ChatGPT conservatively when troubleshooting small bits of code – for example recently it helped me to debug  a piece of code that was displaying a constant value by year. despite my programming it to change value by year. All in all, I intend to keep learning next.js, turning to GPT only if necessary.

2.	Get comfortable with issue driven project management.

I’ve become more comfortable navigating the Kanban board for IDPM on GitHub. One thing I’ve learned, is the importance of code reviews (kind of related to IDPM). By doing them weekly, I’ve learned how to identify problematic pieces of code in others’ commits, something that I would need when I go to industry.

3.	Break the habit of using Vanilla JavaScript and CSS for everything.

In 314, I trusted my own coding more than others and wasn’t a fan of the frameworks. I didn’t like how the frameworks we were using were “black-boxed”, and I just fed it values without much options to customize it nor understand its inner workings. However, I’ve slowly started to appreciate the frameworks as I’ve approached a project of this magnitude. Everything looks uniform, sleek, and smooth. It’s very easy to code things like toggle buttons without having to rely on complicated state management. Going forward, I intend to use my own code for smaller projects, but rely on frameworks/libraries for larger projects that need to be finished within a time limit.
